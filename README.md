Description 
# 🌳 Decision Tree Classifier – ML Task

This project implements a **Decision Tree Classifier** using Python and scikit-learn. It is used to classify data based on features and learn patterns using tree-based logic.

## 📁 Files Included
- `decision_tree.py`: Main code file for training and testing the model
- `dataset.csv`: Input dataset used for classification (if included)
- `README.md`: Project description

## 📌 Objective
To demonstrate how a decision tree algorithm works on a sample dataset and how it can be used to predict categorical outcomes.

## 🧪 Libraries Used
- `pandas` – for data manipulation
- `numpy` – for numerical operations
- `sklearn` – for model building (DecisionTreeClassifier)
- `matplotlib` / `graphviz` – for visualizing the tree (optional)

## ⚙️ How to Run

You can run this project in **Google Colab**, **Jupyter Notebook**, or any Python IDE:

```python
# Install required libraries if needed
!pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

# Then run the script
python decision_tree.py

## ✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates a simple yet powerful implementation of the **Decision Tree Classification** algorithm. By using real or sample datasets, it shows how decision trees can be trained to make predictions based on input features. 

Decision trees are:
- Easy to interpret
- Require little data preparation
- Suitable for both classification and regression tasks

This project serves as a solid foundation for understanding decision trees and can be further extended using techniques like pruning, feature importance, and model tuning for better accuracy.
